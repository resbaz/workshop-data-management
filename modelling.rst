    Originally we had these fields on the Workshop. But then we started to think about some
    Instructors or Helpers in one subject could be students in another and vice versa. So we
    have taken these out and created an intermediatory class for each.
    See here for more on intermediatory classes

.. note::
    '''
    Originally we had the Org on the Person model, but realised that would
    skew our data because a person may belong to a number of orgs and we
    are looking to distinguish *per workshop*. Hence moving the org data
    to these intermediate classes.
