workshop-data-management

This project is a combination of practical and educational - we are creating a
small web based database application for the management of the Research 
Platforms workshops, to provide some broad stroke analysis of those workshops,
and also to be a read world tutorial for an intro to data modelling and a more
difficult Django, one that is harder than most regular tutorials, and our 
introduction tutorial.



The file modelling.rst was created by Damien and I just bashing out ideas of 
what the data should look like. It's an initial take that may change as the
project develops.

The first tutorial is based on the that file and the ideas that Damien and I
had that lead to the models.
